# Demystifying Patent Activity: The Link between Innovation and Company Performance
#### *"Exploring the influence of R&D investment and patents on business outcomes across industries"*

## About
This project investigates the relationship between a companyâ€™s internal innovation driversâ€”such as R&D spending and patent activityâ€”and financial performance. Using detailed datasets from Compustat/WRDS and patent records, we quantify how different innovation strategies impact profitability, patent output, and competitive positioning.

## Data Sources

- **Financial Data:** Compustat & WRDS (revenue, profit, R&D expenses, ROA).
- **Patent Data:** Two datasets covering patent activity, types, yearly summaries, and industry classification.

## Project Goals

- Assess how R&D expenditure and patenting activity drive changes in Return on Assets (ROA).
- Quantify the effect of patent characteristics (year, type, industry) on company innovation output.
- Analyze external influences including competition, regulatory pressures, and consumer adoption.

## Analysis Overview

- **Regression Models:**  
  - Linked internal drivers (R&D spend, number of patents) and patent features to ROA and patent counts.
  - Evaluated statistical reliability of models and addressed multicollinearity.

- **Key Findings:**  
  - All modeled variables showed statistically significant but modest influence on ROA and patent output.
  - ROA model proved robust and well-specified.
  - Collinearity between functional and design patents limited their independent analysisâ€”resulting in exclusion from final models.
  - Missing financial data reduced explanatory power in some cases.

- **Business Insights:**  
  - Innovation is a multifaceted driver: patents and R&D contribute to performance, but external factors like market adoption, competition, and regulation play substantial roles.
  - Companies should balance patent portfolio growth with investment in competitive intelligence and customer-driven innovation.

## Challenges

- **Data Quality:** Missing values in financial metrics posed analysis limitations.
- **Multicollinearity:** High correlation between functional and design patent counts required exclusion from detailed regression.
- **Computation Cost:** Large data files led to higher processing times.

## How to Reproduce / Run Analysis

1. Download project files and datasets from the repository.
2. Install necessary Python libraries (`pandas`, `statsmodels`, `numpy`, etc.) as listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Open and run the main analysis notebook (`Demystifying_Patent_Activity.ipynb`) for step-by-step EDA, regression results, and visualization.
4. Follow comments to adapt data sources or extend analysis.

## Future Improvements

- Integrate additional financial and market metrics to boost model explanatory power.
- Test causal relationships with instrumental variables or panel data methods.
- Explore cross-industry comparisons to highlight sector-specific innovation drivers.

## Coursework
